This is my project. 

Of course there is a lot of work to do on it and during the course I wished I could work on it more and more.

Now it is the time to move to my new project (or job hopefully).

The design of the project UI is very simple (I think..)
I used several features such as:

1. VERY IMPORTANT! Drag and drop for images upload- for that to work on your data base you need to change the IMAGE column type to CLOB type. (in DerbyDB).
2. Angular filter instead of calling to the server.
3. Bootstrap design widgets.
4. Html confirm for forms.
5. Angular ngConfirm.(in delete company for example)
6. I tried to use the server message in every error that I got (in the login page the error messages are from the core for example).

Hope you will have fun checking it..
